Dan Heidinga wears two hats: first as an Eclipse OpenJ9 project lead, and the second as a Red Hat employee. Fortunately, both of those hats let him hack on the OpenJ9 JVM which he's been doing since 2007. Along the way he's been part of the Expert Groups for multiple JSRS including JSR 292 ('invokedynamic') and JSR 335 ('lambda') and is currently part of the Amber and Valhalla EGs.

He has his hands in most new JVM features and all major Java releases. In the past he's spent entirely too long staring at Java bytecode while maintaining the bytecode verifier and still enjoys an occasional detour into Smalltalk development.
